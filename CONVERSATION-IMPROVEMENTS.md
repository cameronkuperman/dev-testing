# Conversation Improvements

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Pronunciation
- Changed "Cameron Kuperman" to "Cameron Cooperman" throughout the system
- This ensures Mei pronounces the name correctly as "Cooperman"

### 2. Reduced Repetition
Updated system prompt with specific rules:
- **NEVER repeat** what the patient just said
- **Jump straight** to helpful information
- **Use brief acknowledgments** like "Sure", "Of course", "Let me help"
- **Avoid phrases** like "You mentioned...", "I hear you saying..."

### 3. Natural Conversation Flow
- Responses are now **concise and direct**
- Mei sounds like a **knowledgeable friend**, not a robotic assistant
- Simple greeting: "Hi Cameron, how can I help you today?"
- **No unnecessary explanations** unless asked

## Example Conversations

### Before:
User: "I have a headache"
Mei: "I understand you're experiencing a headache. Let me help you with that headache you're having..."

### After:
User: "I have a headache"
Mei: "I can help with that. How long have you had it, and where exactly does it hurt?"

### Before:
User: "Hi Mei"
Mei: "Hello! I heard you say hi. I'm Mei, your medical assistant, and I'm here to help you today..."

### After:
User: "Hi Mei"
Mei: "Hi Cameron, how can I help you today?"

## Testing
Restart the proxy server to apply these changes. Mei should now:
- Sound more natural and conversational
- Never repeat your words back to you
- Get straight to the point with helpful information
- Pronounce "Cooperman" correctly
